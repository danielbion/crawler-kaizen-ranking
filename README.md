This project was born out of a personal need to understand which classes in the private server version of MapleStory are the most promising based on rankings. Before diving into the game and creating my character, I decided it was best to make an informed decision. 

Using Python, I developed a crawler that fetches ranking information directly from the game's website, providing insights into which class to choose.
